# [website for this repo](https://boogie-programming.github.io/boogiehasfun-website)



### this repo is separated from [BoogieHasFun/websitefiles-boogiehasfun.netlify.com](https://github.com/BoogieHasFun/websitefiles-boogiehasfun.netlify.com), but they are using the same code (for right now). this is for the organization and may be different one day. 

hi! <br>
this is the readme file. <br> if your on the website discard this file. <br>
if your on the [github page](https://github.com/BoogieHasFun/websitefiles-boogiehasfun.netlify.com) you can check out the [website.](https://boogiehasfun.netlify.app/)

this contains the source for [this website](https://boogiehasfun.netlify.app/) <br>
the website uses netlify for hosting. <br>
see [the original source code](https://github.com/BoogieHasFun/github-boogiehasfun) for the other links that this is hosted on. <br>
<strong><i> be warned that the original website and source code is not updated much because i have to manually update it. with netlify, it updates automatically. this repo is going to use github-pages instead.  </i></strong>

:D
